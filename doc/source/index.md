# MStruct

## Installation

### Deployment overview

	MStruct projects provides 2 main components:
	
	- *mstruct* program for powder diffraction data refinement
	- *module* for powder diffraction analysis with Python and Jupyter notebooks

	Windows, MacOS and Linux all are supported, however the level of intagration
    is varying. See the table below for a detailed overview.

	In short

	- Windows binaries are very small (few MBs) and easy to download and run but
      you will not get the Python module. Maybe you do not care.
	- Anaconda is the most universal. You will get all MStruct features without
      limitations but you need to have Anaconda enviroment. It occupies around
      2-3 GBs however you may use it also for something else. You will need to
      compile MStruct yourself, short instructions are provided, we tested it but
      some problems cannot be exlucluded (just try it!)
    - Linux native compilation will give you all features and will not use
      much space. Compilation process is same as with Anaconda, however you
      may prefer to use Anaconda to protect your system against dirty MStruct :-)
