\begin{DoxyParagraph}{Included libraries}
Software libraries distributed with this package (but not written by V. Favre-\/Nicolin) do not fall under the terms of the above copyright and license: these are the atominfo, sglite and newmat package. You should refer to the documentation and legal notes included in their respective directories: 
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
{\tt The newmat matrix library} (Robert B Davies). This library is only used for matrix SVD decomposition and inversion in Least Squares methods (Least Squares method was written only for tests purposes... Don't expect anything from it...). 
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
{\tt The atominfo library}(Ralf Grosse-\/Kunstleve). This library is used to determine the atomic scattering factors for X-\/Ray, neutrons, as well as anomalous scattering factors and the atomic number. 
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
{\tt The SgLite library}(Ralf Grosse-\/Kunstleve). Note that this package is part of the {\tt PyMOL Molecular Graphics System} (used with permission), and is not free software. It is used to derive symmetry operations from a given spacegroup symbol or number.
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
{\tt The Blitz++ array library} (Todd Veldhuizen). This library is used for data storage and calculation in arrays and vectors. (Currently it is {\itshape not\/} used because of the huge memory requirements when compiling blitz++ expressions using the gcc compiler. Instead the \doxyref{CrystVector}{p.}{a00024} and \doxyref{CrystMatrix}{p.}{a00023} are used, emulating the blitz interface, but without the smart handling of mathematical expressions.) Support for the Blitz++ should come back some time...
