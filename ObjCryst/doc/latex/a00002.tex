\begin{DoxyParagraph}{\-Included libraries}
\-Software libraries distributed with this package (but not written by \-V. \-Favre-\/\-Nicolin) do not fall under the terms of the above copyright and license\-: these are the atominfo, sglite and newmat package. \-You should refer to the documentation and legal notes included in their respective directories\-: 
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
{\tt \-The newmat matrix library} (\-Robert \-B \-Davies). \-This library is only used for matrix \-S\-V\-D decomposition and inversion in \-Least \-Squares methods (\-Least \-Squares method was written only for tests purposes... \-Don't expect anything from it...). 
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
{\tt \-The atominfo library}(\-Ralf \-Grosse-\/\-Kunstleve). \-This library is used to determine the atomic scattering factors for \-X-\/\-Ray, neutrons, as well as anomalous scattering factors and the atomic number. 
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
{\tt \-The \-Sg\-Lite library}(\-Ralf \-Grosse-\/\-Kunstleve). \-Note that this package is part of the {\tt \-Py\-M\-O\-L \-Molecular \-Graphics \-System} (used with permission), and is not free software. \-It is used to derive symmetry operations from a given spacegroup symbol or number.
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
{\tt \-The \-Blitz++ array library} (\-Todd \-Veldhuizen). \-This library is used for data storage and calculation in arrays and vectors. (\-Currently it is {\itshape not\/} used because of the huge memory requirements when compiling blitz++ expressions using the gcc compiler. \-Instead the \doxyref{\-Cryst\-Vector}{p.}{a00024} and \doxyref{\-Cryst\-Matrix}{p.}{a00023} are used, emulating the blitz interface, but without the smart handling of mathematical expressions.) \-Support for the \-Blitz++ should come back some time...
