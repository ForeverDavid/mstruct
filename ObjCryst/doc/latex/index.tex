\subsection{\-Warning-\/ General documentation outdated}\label{index_warning}
\-Most of the general text in this documentation (status, etc...) is really outdated, but should be helpful to understand the general use about the library. \-The detailed class documentation, however, is always up-\/to-\/date (it can be incomplete, though).\subsection{\%\-Obj\-Cryst++ Object-\/\-Oriented Crystallographic Library}\label{index_index}

\subsection{\-News}\label{index_news}
\-The new version of \-Obj\-Cryst++ has been added to \-Sourceforge. \-Note that there could remain missing points in the documentation, especially for the graphical interface part (wx\-Cryst).

\-The new version includes major changes for several classes (\-Scattering\-Power, \-Powder\-Pattern), and includes the graphical classes associated with all objects using {\tt wx\-Windows}, and saving all objects using a new, more expandable {\tt \-X\-M\-L}-\/based format.\subsection{\-Introduction}\label{index_intro}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{\-Overview of the project}

\end{DoxyParagraph}
\-The aim of this project is to provide object-\/oriented tools for \-Crystallography. \-The focus of these tools is the analysis of diffraction data, with an emphasis on speed optimization for repetitive calculations (for global refinement methods such as simulated annealing, for example).

\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
\-To have an overview of all available libraries, go to the {\tt \-Class \-Hierarchy}. 
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
\-Even if we intend to use this library mainly for the development of a global optimization program from powder diffraction, this library is programmed in a general way so that other applications can make use of it. \-The library was designed to be reusable, by adding new kind of experiments, new algorithms, new \-Scatterer type, new \-Scattering\-Power,... \-See \doxyref{\-The \-Design of \-Obj\-Cryst++}{p.}{a00004} to learn more about the object-\/oriented design of this library and why it is good for its expandability.

\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
\-This project was initiated in the laboratory of \-Crystallography of the \-University of \-Geneva ({\tt http\-://www.\-unige.\-ch/crystal/}), and is part of the development of a global optimization program with \-Radovan \-Cerny ({\tt http\-://www.\-unige.\-ch/crystal/cerny/rcerny.\-htm}).
