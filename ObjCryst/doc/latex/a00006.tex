(stars indicate priority/complexity \-: ($\ast$$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$,$\ast$$\ast$) is urgent,fairly easy)\subsection{\-Outside features}\label{a00006_external}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{\-Examples}
\-Make a few examples for each feature... 
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{\-Compilation}
\-Make the library and test programs compilable for other \-O\-S\&configuration... \-So far tests have been made on \-Linux (x86/ppc), \-Mac\-O\-S and windows (cygwin) \-Need to work on autoconf and automake (...)
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\subsection{\-Library Features}\label{a00006_general}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{\-Check \-Results ($\ast$$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$,$\ast$) (in constant progress)}
\-Compare \-Structure \-Factors with the results of other programs (\-Jana,...) for a number of different spacegroups. 
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{\-Save \& restore objects ($\ast$$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$,$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$) \-D\-O\-N\-E, using \-X\-M\-L}

\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{\-Move from atominfo+sglite to cctbx ($\ast$$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$,$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$)}
\-Change to the newest \-R. \-Grosse-\/\-Kunstleve library. 
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{\-C\-I\-F \-Import \& \-Export ($\ast$$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$,$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$)}
\-Ability to export (and import) \-Crystallographic \-Info \-Files. \-The importing will be much harder, and is not a priority. 
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{\-Export to other \-L\-S\-Q refinement programs($\ast$$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$,$\ast$$\ast$)}
\-Ability to export for other refinement programs (fullprof, gsas, shellx,...). 
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{\-Anisotropic \-Thermic \-Factors ($\ast$$\ast$,$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$)}
\-Add support for anisotropic thermic factors. \-Spacegroup object should be able to indicate the permutations needed for symetrical atoms. \-Also determine the constraints between bij (eg beta12=beta13,etc...) \-The \-Interface has been written, but no code. 
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{\-Powder \-Diffraction \-Background($\ast$$\ast$,$\ast$$\ast$)}
\-Use splines to interpolate background. \-Automagically determine background by filtering the spectrum. \-So far only linearly-\/interpolated background is available. 
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{\-Intensity extraction from powder ($\ast$,$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$)}
\-Extract \-F(hkl) from a powder spectrum. \-Not so interesting, there already are numerous programs to do this. \-But the advantage to have it embeded is the possibility to refine and refresh (recycle) these extracted intensities during an optimization. 
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{\-Multi-\/phase ($\ast$$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$,$\ast$$\ast$) -\/ \-D\-O\-N\-E}
\-Multiple phase for powder diffraction. 
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{\-Z\-Scatterer import($\ast$$\ast$,$\ast$$\ast$)}
\-Import \-Z-\/\-Matrix from file. \-Add the possibility to link two existing \-Z\-Scatterer by linking terminal atoms. 
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{\-Genetic \-Algorithm ($\ast$$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$,$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$)}
\-And compare the 3 different algorithms on several structures. 
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{\-Texture ($\ast$$\ast$$\ast$,$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$)}
\-Include texture parameters in \-Powder\-Pattern. \-Optionnaly, allow multiple textured patterns (that would more difficult).
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\subsection{\-Internal Design of the Library}\label{a00006_internal}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{\-Vector \& arrays (\-Blitz++ usage,...) ($\ast$$\ast$,$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$)}
\-Test again the use of the blitz++ library for vector computing.
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\subsection{\-Wild ideas (interesting possibilities, but no priority given)}\label{a00006_wild}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{\-Amorphous contribution}
\-Add amorphous (disordered) contributions to powder spectrum. \-This could be easily added from the \-Powder\-Pattern\-Component base class. 
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{\-Magnetic scattering}
\-Add calculations for magnetic scattering (-\/$>$scattering factors) 
\end{DoxyParagraph}
